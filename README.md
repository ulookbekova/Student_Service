Student Issue Handling Service Web Application  
In our university there are many administrative issues and questions sent by students to coordinators via e-mail which makes troubleshooting unorganized, hard to manage and uncomfortable to do. Therefore we would like to implement a web service that manages communication between students and coordinators and other administrative persons much simpler and faster. Logging in as a student there will be an interface for choosing the issue category and submitting the request which will be sent to the proper administrative people in an organized way to make the problem obvious from the first sight. As for coordinators' interface , there will be all the features needed to sort and to handle issues like to get some template answers or putting the issue into priority category.



Forth and back communication features shall be implemented as well



The site itself will contain all the basic administrative information and updates
